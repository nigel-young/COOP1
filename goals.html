            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              This semester I wanted to be aware of and understand various different success factors for project completion.
              Its not enough that I am aware of my own role is a projects life cycle, but I also wanted to be aware and informed
              of various other roles and responsibilities that contribute to a project system, and also be aware of the roles that
              facilitate a project moving through various other RBC systems. 	By the end of the term I want to be comfortable with the
              RBC project ecosystem, and the various roles and processes that contribute to project success.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              the end of this work term at RBC, I was required to understand the function and inner workings of various projects
              in order to move between one environment and another. I was successful in grasping these complex systems as well as moving these projects.

            <h5>Goal Developement</h5>
            <p>
              My goals for this semester have changed a lot since the beginning. The goals to the left are actually
              the second draft of goals after my job switched to developer. In the beginning, my goals were more specialized towards
              project management and excel spreadsheet making, but as I took on more responsibility and drifted away from my original
              goal, I changed my goals to be more in line with the work I was doing. My 3rd goal exemplifies how I chose more realistic goals
              that I could work towards in my new role.

            <h4>Professional & Ethical Behaviour</h4>
            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              This term I hope to improve my teamwork, and become accustomed to working in an agile environment
              I hope to work closely with teamates to improve my group communications skills, and begin speaking up in meetings.
              By the end of the semester I hope to be an active, contributing member of the team
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              At the end of this work term, I was successful in working with each of my team members in some way.

          <h4>Critical and Creative Thinking</h4>
          <h5>Goal</h5>
          <p>
            This term I hope to be an important enough member of the development team that I will be regularly contributing to production code.
            I hope to work closely with the lead developer by shadowing and learning the technique for moving a user story to production.
            By the end of the semester I hope to be an integral member of the development team, and to have code that I've written in production.
          </p>
          <h5>Reflection</h5>
          <p>
            By the end of this term, I had code that I had written that was successfully running in production (which is super exciting to think about)!
