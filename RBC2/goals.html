            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h4>Critical and Creative Thinking</h4>
            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              I hope to learn what it means to be a Technical Systems Analyst by the end of the semester.
              I am shadowing a TSA as he begins work on another project.
              By the end of the semester, I hope to know what the role entails and be able to perform the
              role of a TSA to an acceptable degree
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              I have learned about the the tasks a TSA must undertake, and have a better understanding of what needs
              to be done in the role and the decisions a TSA has to make. Next semester I will be working as a TSA so I
              will get to understand it more first hand.
            </p>

            <h5>Goal Developement</h5>
            <p>
              My Goals this semester were less so based around tasks that I was assigned and more around tasks that I
              would like to do. For example, shadowing a TSA was more related to TSA work that I was hoping to do in the
              future and less to do with my current Devops tasks.

          <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 content rounded" style="background-color: #c7bbc9;">
            <h4>Communicating</h4>
            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              I hope to improve my presentation skills. I am working with my manager to give me opportunities
              to present when possible. By the end of the seemster, I hope to be comfortable enough with public speaking
              that it doesn't ruin my day when I know I have to do it, and be able to effectively communicate what needs
              to be communicated.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, I only got the chance to speak publicly once during this term.
              I still am uncomfortable speaking publicly and I hope to develop this skill more in the future
            </p>

            <h5>Technologies</h5>
            <p>
              This semester I worked with a lot of technology that is new to me. I was unaware of the ability to
              construct jenkins pipelines using jenkinsfiles and groovy pipeline libraries. I also learned a lot about
              other technologies, including jenkins config as code and openshift, as well as setting up a logstash instance.

        <div class="row justify-content-start top-buffer">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 content rounded" style="background-color: #c7bbc9;">
            <h4>Critical and Creative Thinking</h4>
            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              I hope to better understand design patterns. I will be studying and hopefully implementing my thinking
              with design patterns in my role shadowing a TSA. By the end of the semester, I hope to be comfortable
              with my knowledge of design patterns and their implementation.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              I took notes on all the important design patterns pointed out to me by my manager and have a better
              grasp and understanding of their implementation in projects.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 margin-left rounded" style="background-color: #bfb5b2;">
            <h5>Skill</h5>
            <p>
              The main skill i was hoping to learn this semester was public speaking. Unfortunately that didn't work out
              very well, as a lot of the chances I could have had to speak publicly were quashed by Covid-19. In the
              future I hope to make this a priority as being able to share you're ideas with other effectively is a very
              important skill in my field.
            </p>
