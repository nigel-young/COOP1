            <h2>Job</h2>

              <p>
                This summer I was working with the Core Service Integration team. The team that<br>
                I was apart of was responsible for creating new API's and connecting them to back end services<br>
<br>
                Most of the work I did this summer was related to devops tasks. I was working on a pipeline that allowed<br>
                for a more streamlined application deployment. This involved the use of JenkinsFiles included in project directories<br>
                that made projects autodeploy on a codebase change or if a merge was made in VCS. Most of this work was done<br>
                through Groovy scripts and interacting with various API's to acquire data needed for some of the deploy processes.<br>
                I learned a lot of the skills necessary for this job from my last work term at the Cooperators.<br>
<br>
                The most challenging part about this work term was maintaining a good work ethic while working from home.<br>
                Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the entirety of my co-op work term was done online. This made it difficult<br>
                to separate my home life from my work life. It was very difficult to stay on task and I had to implement a <br>
                number of strategies to try and separate those parts of my life. At the end of my term I think I had a better <br>
                handle on maintaining the right mindset around work from home.<br>
