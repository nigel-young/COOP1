            <h2>Job</h2>

              <p>
                This summer I was working with the Core Banking Integration data services team. The team that
                I was apart of was in charge of exposing information in our backend legacy system for another team
                making a more modern easy to use app.

                The current task was exposing information in our mortgage system (LINX) and exposing it for our OMNI
                team so our mortgage specialists can more easily track the progress of their applications.

                Most of the work i did on this project was the PCF portion, the REST web service that accepts application
                information sent from LINX and transforms the data inside so it is more easily readable for the app team.
                Most of this involved Java coding (which I learned in school in OOP) and technologies such as Jenkins and Maven
                for builds and deploys.

                The most challenging part about this work term was taking initiative in my tasks. I was onboarded as a Project
                Control Officer. Throughout the term I took it upon myself to pick up tasks in areas more relevant
                to my future career. My manager Heather was very helpful In allowing me to branch away from my original hired
                role. Taking up more tasks allowed me to pick up more tasks and eventually take on the role of developer
                on the PCF portion. If I did not take the initiative I would be doing excel spreadsheets all summer, and since
                I was able to learn and enjoy skills relevant to my program.
