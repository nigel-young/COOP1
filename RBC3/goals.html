            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h4>Critical and Creative Thinking</h4>
            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              My Job as a TSA co-op is to do all the work required for various projects related to PCF cloud work,
              including the creation and modification of Springboot API's and the various RBC related configuration that
              comes with it. By the end of the term, I hope to have the capabilities of a full-fledged TSA.
              I will learn the various tasks required for a TSA through working on various projects in the cloud space.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              I have learned about the the tasks a TSA must undertake, and have a better understanding of what needs
              to be done in the role and the decisions a TSA has to make. Next semester I will be working as a TSA so I
              will get to understand it more first hand.

            <h5>Goal Developement</h5>
            <p>
              My goals this semester were more based around the actual tasks assigned to be as opposed to personal goals.
              This is due to the fact that I was kept busy at most moments by the tasks given to me.

            <h4>Communicating</h4>
            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              Increase my knowledge of code smells and what they are. I hope to fix various code smells present in a
              legacy project to learn more about what they are. I will be successful if I have a workable understanding
              of code smells.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              I have learned about various code smells and how to identify them in my code.
            </p>

            <h5>Technologies</h5>
            <p>
              This semester I didnt work with too many new technologies. Most of the stuff I worked with I was already
              familiar with like Springboot and Jenkins. The only real new technology I got to spend more time with was
              Sonarqube, with is a technology for screening code quality.

            <h4>Critical and Creative Thinking</h4>
            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              By the end of the semester, I hope to be proficient in touch typing. 	I will practice touch typing in the
              evening using keybr typing learning tool. By the end of the semester I hope to be able to type without
              looking at the keyboard with a proficient WPM.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              I have reached a WPM of 50 which is much higher than me previous 40
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 margin-left rounded" style="background-color: #bfb5b2;">
            <h5>Skill</h5>
            <p>
              The main skill I was hoping to work on this work term was touch typing. I've recently gotten into building
              my own keyboards and its a bit embarrassing that I can't type well on them. I believe I am now doing them
              justice.
