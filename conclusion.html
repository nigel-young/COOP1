            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              In conclusion, this RBC work term has really helped me realize the importance of <br>
              taking initiative. I was incredibly lucky that my manager was such a great person <br>
              who really wanted me to learn and grow as a worker. Allowing me to find my own place in <br>
              the team really allowed for me to get the most I could out of this work term. <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              This work term helped me improve as a teamate as well as a programmer. I learned so much <br>
              about data pipelines, as well as how to use SpringBoot to code a RESTful webservice, as well <br>
              as what it means to develop a 12 Factor App. I'm happy with my learning in an agile environment, <br>
              and will be able to take that experience with me to my next work term

            <h2>Acknowledements</h2>
            <p>
              I would like to thank RBC for having me this summer. I would also like to thank our <br>
              technical analyst, Joe, for taking me under his wing this semester and teaching me about <br>
              proper developement techniques, as well as giving me the resources to learn about new and <br>
              exciting technologies. I'd also like to thank my manager Heather, as she let me explore <br>
              my options and opportunities, and to pick my role on her team. I'd also like to thank the <br>
              co-op team for even giving me this fantastic opportunity <br>
              <br>
              Last of all, I'd like to thank you for reading!<br>
