            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h4>Critical and Creative Thinking</h4>
            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              This semester, I hope to write code and scripts that are translatable and useful for years to come.
              I hope to achieve this by writing easy to read, modular code with good documentation to make it easier on future employees and co-ops.
              I will be satisfied with my work when I am able to look at my code and understand it at a glance
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              I have taken the effort to have my code read over by peers for legibility,
              and taken into account their opinions and criticisms to write the most concise and readable code that I can.
            </p>

            <h5>Goal Developement</h5>
            <p>
              My goals for the semester were based mostly around what I believed were easy enough to work towards in any work
              environment while still being relevant skills to bring with me in my school work as well as my future career.
              The most important for me is definitely the public speaking goal, as I struggle with speaking in front of people who
              I do not know.

            <h4>Professional & Ethical Behaviour</h4>
            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              By the end of this work term I hope to have a deep understanding of the JIRA platform.
              I hope to keep track of stories and how they are submitted, as well as how JIRA is built around agile environments.
              By the end of the semester I hope to have the knowledge to be able to create and manage a JIRA workspace.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              I took part in creating a JIRA service desk, as well as managing and allocating team resources to different tasks that are sent through.
              I managed my JIRA time evectively and experienced the use of agile boards as well as kanban

            <h5>Technologies</h5>
            <p>
              This semester I feel as though I did not get  lot of opportunities to work with technologies that intersted me.
              The Python that I had to write for the controller script was not particularly complicated, and JIRA while useful is not very
              exciting. The Jenkins work that I had to do did delve deeper into the more complicated ways it is used (Pipelines).
              Overall wish that I had more opportunity to use technology that is more modern and applicable for future applications.

            <h4>Critical and Creative Thinking</h4>
            <h5>Goal</h5>
            <p>
              By the end of the semester I hope to be more comfortable communicating my ideas to large groups of people.
              This semester I hope to take any opportunities I can to speak publicly about my ideas and try and convey them in a more coherent manner.
              By the end of the semester I should be more comfortable giving a formal presentation with beforehand preparation.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
              I took efforts to make presentations to the team to work on my public speaking skills. I was effectively able
              to communicate to my team through a presentation on the JIRA service desk I designed as well as how they are affected by its implementation.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4 margin-left rounded" style="background-color: #bfb5b2;">
            <h5>Skill</h5>
            <p>
              The main skill I gained through this work term is public speaking. My manager thought that this was a good idea and had me present
              the JIRA service desk to my team, which definitely helped take some of the fear out of the process. Good communication and being able
              to clearly present ideas is a very important idea that I hope to use in other ventures.
