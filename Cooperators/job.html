            <h2>Job</h2>

              <p>
                This Winter I was tasked with creating a "scheduler" like script in python to automate our deploy<br>
                processes in preparation for the Cooperators moving to cloud server deploys. This process and app development<br>
                was rather painful as most test environments were not suitable for actually testing these deploys and had to be<br>
                fixed before we could test anything<br>
<br>
                The python script involved calling various bash scripts when givin a list of deploy steps, while verifying steps<br>
                were executed successfully. This required a lot of bash script modification, and due to the nature of the test environment<br>
                most testing ended up happing in the last 2 weeks of my co-op<br>
<br>
                I was the sole contributor to this python script, which ended up being one of the main outputs of our team by the end<br>
                of my term as most of my team was pre-occupied with fielding requests from other teams to fix their environments<br>
                This left me with a lot of freedom but also not as much guidance as I would have liked<br>
                I also made and managed a JIRA service desk for my team so we could field all unplanned work in a way that was <br>
                easier to track.<br>
<br>
                My biggest challenge this term was how to budget time and tasks so I had something to do when waiting for<br>
                a dependency to be completed. This involved prioritizing tasks that result in the longest wait before others.<br>
                The skills gained from this hurdle will definitely help me in school and later into my career, as time managements<br>
                is a great skill to have<br>
