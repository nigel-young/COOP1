            <h2>Job</h2>

              <p>
                This summer I was working with the Core Banking Integration data services team. The team that<br>
                I was apart of was in charge of exposing information in our backend legacy system for another team<br>
                making a more modern easy to use app.<br>
<br>
                The current task was exposing information in our mortgage system (LINX) and exposing it for our OMNI<br>
                team so our mortgage specialists can more easily track the progress of their applications.<br>
<br>
                Most of the work i did on this project was the PCF portion, the REST web service that accepts application<br>
                information sent from LINX and transforms the data inside so it is more easily readable for the app team.<br>
                Most of this involved Java coding (which I learned in school in OOP) and technologies such as Jenkins and Maven<br>
                for builds and deploys.<br>

                The most challenging part about this work term was taking initiative in my tasks. I was onboarded as a Project<br>
                Control Officer. Throughout the term I took it upon myself to pick up tasks in areas more relevant<br>
                to my future career. My manager Heather was very helpful In allowing me to branch away from my original hired<br>
                role. Taking up more tasks allowed me to pick up more tasks and eventually take on the role of developer<br>
                on the PCF portion. If I did not take the initiative I would be doing excel spreadsheets all summer, and since<br>
                I was able to learn and enjoy skills relevant to my program.<br>
