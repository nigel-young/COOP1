            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              In conclusion, this Cooperators work term has really helped me realize the importance of <br>
              requirements gathering and proper test environments. During the term when I started coding this<br>
              script, I didnt have much direction in terms of what was required of it. If I took the time at the <br>
              beginning of the semester to go over what was needed from it, I wouldn't have had to do as much<br>
              refactoring later on. As for the proper test environments, I felt a lot of my progress was inhibited<br>
              by the lack of functioning test environments, leaving most of whether or not my program was working to<br>
              guess work.
              <br>
              <br>
              While it seems like I'm casting it in a negative light, I did enjoy my time at the Cooperators. My team was<br>
              great and put a lot of trust in me as a developer which was nice. I also got to learn Python, while not the <br>
              hardest language to learn, will be very useful for my future in software<br>

            <h2>Acknowledements</h2>
            <p>
              I would like to thank Cooperators for having me this fall. I would also like to thank my <br>
              team for being such a pleasure to work with, and for David for teaching me how to juggle on downtime<br>
              I'd also like to thank my manager for pushing me to overcome my fears of public speaking, even if<br>
              it still terrifies me. I'd also like to thank the co-op team for giving me the opportunity to find<br>
              jobs like this one<br>
              <br>
              Last of all, I'd like to thank you for reading!<br>
            </p>
